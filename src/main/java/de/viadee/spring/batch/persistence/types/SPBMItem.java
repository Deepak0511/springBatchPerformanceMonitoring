 * This is the Database representation of an Item-Based Performance-Measurement.
 * It stores the information, how long an item has been active in a particular

 * IMPORTANT: This class makes use of the "toString()" Method of the processed
 * Item in order to empower the Developer to identify the particular Item that
 * has been processed by the dataset inside the Monitoring-Database. Please do
 * use a StringBuffer rather than String concatination in the "toString()"
 * Method of your Items in order to keep the Monitoring-Overhead on a minimal
