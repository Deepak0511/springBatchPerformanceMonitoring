/**
 * This is the Database representation of an Item-Based Performance-Measurement. It stores the information, how long an
 * item has been active in a particular action (Read / Process / Write).
 * 
 * IMPORTANT: This class makes use of the "toString()" Method of the processed Item in order to empower the Developer to
 * identify the particular Item that has been processed by the dataset inside the Monitoring-Database. Please do use a
 * StringBuffer rather than String concatination in the "toString()" Method of your Items in order to keep the
 * monitoring overhead minimal.
 * 
 * This is an immutable class.
